# Data-Analysis-with-SQL
## Task
To evaluate Magist as a partner for strategic expansion to Brazil based on their database with the help of SQL.

## Overview 
Eniac is exploring an expansion to the Brazilian market with the help of a local third-party SaaS company, called Magist. We get a limited glimpse of Magist's database. 

## Context
Eniac is an **online marketplace** specializing in Apple-compatible accessories. It was **founded ten years ago in Spain** and has since grown and expanded to other neighboring countries.

In addition to offering a wide catalog of products at **competitive prices**, Eniac provides **friendly and professional tech support** and consultation to its customers. 

### Challenge: 
*How to scale up to a major business player without losing the human side of the business, which is Eniac's emblem?* 

## Approach
Evaluate Magist on the following criteria:
1. As a standalone company - is the company growing?
2. As a partner for selling high-quality tech accessories
3. Delivery times
4. Customer satisfaction
